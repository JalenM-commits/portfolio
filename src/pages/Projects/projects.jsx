                I am currently working towards releasing music on digital streaming platforms. I have completed several Ableton-Live projects that are now in the final stages of mastering. I am now in the pre content release phase of developing and marketing myself as a musical artist.

                <p>I played through my favourite video game on the hardest difficulty.
                    This involved over 2 hours of gameplay footage, not including cutscenes.
                    It took multiple days of effort to record and perfect this cinematic gameplay.</p>
